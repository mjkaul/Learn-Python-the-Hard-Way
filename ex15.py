txt = open(filename) # new command, open, opens the file listed initially. defines the variable txt as equal to opening the file.

print(txt.read()) # uses the txt variable to open, read, then print out the file.

# Study Drills
# 5. The more often you have to enter the filename, the more likely to introduce human error. Better to import it once, whether through argv or input, and reuse it. To use argv, however, you have to know what to do before starting the script, so overall input is betterâ€”you can explain to the user what's required.
